#create a list of your friends names.
names =["Mariyam","Andy","Hina","Anaya","Ana"]
# Now we use a for loop to access and print each name at a time. 
for name in names:
    print(name)
#we use print statement to print each friends name.
# the loop continues untill it has gone through all the names in the list.
