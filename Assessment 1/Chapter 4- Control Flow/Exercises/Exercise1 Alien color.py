#write an if statement to test wheather the aliens color is green.
#create a variable called as alien_color.

#the if statement will now check if the alien_color is equal to green .
if alien_color == "green":
#if its true than print  the following message.

#version2: write a code that fails the if test (alien_color is not green).
alien_color ="Red"
#the if statement will check if the color is equal to green.
if alien_color =="green":
#if is not equal so the code inside the if block will not be executed leading to no output.
    print("Player just earned 10 points.")


#version 1 is true as the color is green.
#version 2 is false as the color is red.
